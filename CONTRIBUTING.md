## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code and accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. Format your code in Visual Studio Code.
3. Issue that pull request!

## Use a Consistent Coding Style
A Visual Studio Code .editorconfig file is provided in the repo. Open the repo in Visual Studio Code and format the program. This ensures that all programs have consistent styling.
